# Day 2

#### notes:
On day 2 I tried to work with random numbers and arrays, so I created a small magic 8 ball program. It isn't very optimized because half of the 'positiveAnswers' and half of the 'negativeAnswers' will never be chosen.

Sadly I had no time (left) for a propper way to exit the application, though it whould have been simple

(I was thinking of an 'exitArray' that array whould contain some common exit / close keywords, and then the given question would check if the full question is one of the 'exitArray' entries)

## Day 2 conclusion:
successfully created a magic 8 ball cli
