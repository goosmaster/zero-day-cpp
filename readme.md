# Zero Day C++ Challenge

Hi, welcome to my zero day c++ challenge, where I challenge myself to write a small c++ program each day for one month. (From 24/01/2018 to 24/02/2018)

### Zero day?
Zero day is a learning / exercising strategy. The name comes from Zero days of not doing x. I changed x to 'programming c++'

### Why
I have no knowledge of c/c++ so you might ask why I should want to do this. It's simply for me to learn c++ and to see how much I learn in just one month (by challenging myself every day) I am also planning on doing more Zero Day challenges with other languages

### Rules
1. commit at least one time each day for one month

that's it
